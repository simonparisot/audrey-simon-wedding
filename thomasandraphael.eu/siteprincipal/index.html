	<h1>The very beginning</h1>
	<p>
		On the evening of June 29, 2017, we met for a first drink at a Brussels rooftop bar. Raphaël, afraid to impress Thomas by wearing his work suit, went home to change into jeans just before. Thomas realised only upon arrival he had been waiting for a giant. Without having finished our first drink, we were spotted by some of Thomas’ friends.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Not long after, Raphaël passed by the family Andre’s house to finish some of the last champagne served at Julien & Fayda their engagement party. Thomas secretly tasted a piece of Julie & Marwin their wedding cake brought by Raphaël after their wedding. It would not take us long before we committed to sharing our lives together, engaged to be engaged.

	<h1>Dress code</h1>
	
	<p>
		Our winter themed theme: overly dressed // bien trop habillé // bijzonder goedgekleed.<br>
		Is this dress code too confusing? We were afraid so... We will help you out with a small self-test:
	</p>

	<div class="dresscode">
		<p>Overly dressed = well too dressed = come as classy as you can</p>

		<h3>The test</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Wear your classiest suit, tux, dress, sweater or shirt and look at yourself in the mirror.</li>
			<li>You see yourself and think "<i>that's good</i>". Then it's not good.</li>
			<li>You see yourself and think "<i>not classy enough</i>". Then get classier.</li>
			<li>You see yourself and think "<i>that's a bit much, no?</i>". DON’T MOVE, YOU HAVE IT!</li>
			<li>You see yourself  and think "<i>that's way too much…</i>”. Get a hold of yourself and remember it's not your own wedding.</li>
		</ol>
